# Authentication Debugging Guide

## Current Issue: 401 Unauthorized Error

The app is getting a 401 error when trying to access `/api/user`. This is expected behavior when:

1. User hasn't logged in yet
2. No authentication token is stored
3. Token has expired

## What I Fixed

### 1. Improved AuthProvider Initialization

- Now checks for stored token before attempting to get current user
- Prevents unnecessary 401 errors on app startup
- Only tries to authenticate if a token exists

### 2. Better Error Handling

- Reduced noise in console logs for expected 401 errors
- More informative logging for debugging

### 3. Graceful Handling of Unauthenticated State

- App now properly handles the case when user is not logged in
- Recommendations loading is skipped when user is not authenticated

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Your App

```bash
# Stop your Expo development server (Ctrl+C)
npx expo start
```

### Step 2: Check Console Logs

Look for these messages:

- `[AuthProvider] No stored token found, user needs to login` (expected if not logged in)
- `User not authenticated, skipping recommendations load` (expected if not logged in)

### Step 3: Test Login Flow

1. Go to the login screen
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Check console for successful login messages
4. Verify you're redirected to the home screen

### Step 4: Test App Restart

1. Close the app completely
2. Reopen it
3. Check if you're still logged in (should be if token is valid)

## Expected Behavior

### Before Login:

- 401 errors are normal and expected
- App should redirect to login screen
- No recommendations should load

### After Login:

- No more 401 errors
- User data should load
- Recommendations should load
- App should work normally

## If Still Having Issues

### Check Laravel Backend:

1. Verify your Laravel server is running with `--host=0.0.0.0`
2. Test login endpoint directly: `http://192.168.1.69:8000/api/login`
3. Check Laravel logs for any errors

### Check Token Storage:

1. Look for `[AuthProvider] Found stored token` message
2. If not found, the login process isn't saving the token properly

### Check Network:

1. Verify your Android device can reach `192.168.1.69:8000`
2. Test in browser on your phone: `http://192.168.1.69:8000/api/register`

## Success Indicators

When working correctly, you should see:

- No 401 errors after successful login
- User data loads properly
- Recommendations appear on home screen
- App remembers login state after restart
